    <center><h3>The Rule Driven Input Generator
    </h3></center>
    <p>
        The <b>Rule-Driven Input Simulating Program (RDISP)</b> is, in general, a <font color="#009900">
        DsdsseCell input generator</font>, representing the case when the DsdsseCell input depends on
        its current state.
    </p>

    <p>
        In many modeled cases, the state of the DsdsseCell
        (or, the value the DsdsseCell takes) is strictly defined as
        the function of state of some other Cells and can be changed
        only when the state of the other Cells is changed. Such state
        is considered to be a <font color="#009900">stable</font> one.
        Meanwhile, sometimes there
        may exist some <font color="#009900">unstable</font> states. These states can be changed
        spontaneously, without any visible reasons.
    </p>

    <p>
        The DsdsseCell's spontaneous transition from some particular state
        to another particular state is simulated with RDISP.
        This program is specified
        as a set of rules, and each rule is described as triplet:
    </p>
    <center>
        <p><b><font color="#990000">Conditional&nbsp;State-Ticks-Target&nbsp;State</font></b>.</p>
        // <p><b><font color="#990000">Ticks-State</font></b>.</p>
    </center>
    <p>


        The <b><font color="#990000">Conditional State</font></b> is the unstable state at which
        the spontaneous transition takes place.

        The <b><font color="#990000">Ticks</font></b> is the number of simulating ticks, which have to
        pass before the transition happens, so, they represent
        the life time of the unstable state. And the <b><font color="#990000">Target State</font></b> is
        the state, which has to replace the unstable one.

    </p>

    <p>
        To create the Rule-Driven Input Simulating Program you have to:
    <ol>
        <li><p>
            insert into the table desired number of rules (rows);
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            select one of the rules to define it;
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            pick up the state value from the <font color="#009900">Allowed States List</font>
            to set the state value for the rule's Conditional State;
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            set the amount of ticks for the selected rule according to the format described below;
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            pick up the state value from the <font color="#009900">Allowed States List</font>
            to set the state value for the rule's Target State;
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            repeat items 2 through 5 for all program rules.
        </p></li>
    </ol>
    sb.append(format);
