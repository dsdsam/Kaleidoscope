    <blockquote><b>The Model is created on the basis of Multi-Color Logical
        Net (MCLNet) formalism.</b>

        <p>
            <b>When the DDSSE is started the default Model named <font
                    color="#008000">"Model 000"</font> is automatically set.</b></p>

        <p
                ><b>Use <font color="#0000FF">New Model</font> menu or toolbar button to set new Model each time
            when new model creation is started. The new default Model name <font color="#008000">"Model XXX"</font>,
            where <font color="#008000">XXX</font>
            is the number of models created in project, is set.</b></p>

        <p><b>Creating the model is straight forward and takes fore simple steps.</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>First, you create Cells - the elements which represent discrete variables
                    of the system.</b></li>

            <li>
                <b>Then you create Junctions - the elements which represent rules that
                    are governing the Cells state.</b></li>

            <li>
                <b>As the third step, you connect the Junctions to the Cells and the
                    Cells to the Junctions with Arcs.</b></li>

            <li>
                <b>Finally, you set initial state of the Cells and Arcs and save the Project
                    on your hard drive.</b></li>
        </ul>
        <b>That is all.</b>

        <p><b>When operating with Model:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>
                <b> use left mouse button to indicate new elements location or to
                    pick up existing one;</b></p></li>
            <li><p>
                <b>use right mouse button to bring an element popup menu,
                    to undo preceding currentOperation step or to quit the currentOperation.

        <b>To create Cells push the menu or toolbar button "Create
            Cells" and just pick points on the Project Area of the screen by

            <li><p>

            <li><p>
                <b>Pick the desired location for Junction. Two Arcs connecting selected
                    Cells with Junction will appear.</b></p></li>

            <li><p>
                <b>To finish creating the rule create additional Arcs using <a href="#HTCA">"How
                    to Create Arc"</a> technique.</b></p></li>
        </ol>

        <b>To create oriented Junctions use one of four "Create Junction" menu
            or toolbar button allowing to create Vertical, Horizontal, Slanted to
            the Right and Slanted to the Left Junctions. Push the button with one
            of appropriate for particular case orientation and pick points on the Project Area of the screen by
            pressing left mouse button to locate
            Junction or right mouse button to remove created one or quit the

    <blockquote>
        <p><b>The arc is created in rubber bending mode and goes from
            its input node (a Cell or a Junction) to its output node (a Junction
            or a Cell) respectively. Pick the input
            node of the arc and draw the mouse in the desired direction. The arc line
            will follow the mouse. The shape of the arc may be different and you have
            choices here.</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>you can create straight arc by picking up output node right after

            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>you may create three point arc by picking up output node right after
                        the input node was picked and then continuing to move mouse apart from
                        output Arc. The Arc connecting the nodes will be banding according to current
                        mouse location. Third pick will finish the Arc creating and the Arc
                        Knob will be placed at the last point picked.</b></p></li>
