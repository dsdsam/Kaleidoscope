        Discrete Symbolic Dynamical Systems Development & Simulating Environment
    </div>

    <div class="content">

        <p>The Discrete Symbolic Dynamical Systems Development & Simulating Environment (DSDS DSE) is a combination
            of <em>Graphical Model Creator</em> and <em>Simulating Engine</em>. Respectively,
            the application can be set to operate in either Model Development or Model Simulation mode.
            By default started application is set to run in Model Development mode.</p>

        <p> In the Model Development mode user uses Graphical Model Creator's tools to sketch and develop
            discrete symbolic dynamical system model on the screen. </p>

        <p> In the Model Simulation mode user communicates with Simulating Engine to run the simulation of
            the model behavior and to visualize the process of its state to state transitions over time. </p>

        <p> When working with DSDS DSE user deals with a Project and a Model. Both the Project and the Model have their
            name assigned at creation time. The Project contains the Model. The Project can be saved, retrieved,
            modified, and saved again. It also can be destroyed when is no more needed. </p>

        <p> Developed discrete symbolic dynamical system model is a representation of modeled dynamical system
            properties, the property states, and the dependency of each property state from
            the states of other properties. All properties are perceived as discrete and symbolic.
            Thus, each property is represented as a discrete variable that may take different symbolic
            states at different times.</p>

        <p> The model behavior is determined by dependency rules that map
            particular combinations of states of some variables - the
            situations - into the states of some other depended on those situations variables.</p>

        <p>The steps of working with DSDS DSE include:

        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Creation of a Project and a Model.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Simulation of the Model behavior over time.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Analysis of the Model behavior.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Modification of the Model to suite the modeling goals.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        </p>
