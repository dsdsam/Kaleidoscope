# Kaleidoscope

The Kaleidoscope is a research and development project.
It is presented on the web site Discrete Symbolic Dynamical Systems & Models:  http://www.dsdsam.com.
And in the GitHub Pages web site:  https://dsdsam.github.io/Kaleidoscope/.
The intention of the project is to develop Discrete Symbolic Dynamical Systems (DSDS) modeling thchnique and supporting the technique software tools.

Project description

The project consists of three major parts: 
1) Multicolored Logical Net (McLN) - a Discrete Symbolic Dynamical Systems Modeling Formalism (MF).
2) Space Exploration Mission (SEM)  - a Java desktop application that is supposed to be controlled by
the McLN controller. 
3) Discrete Symbolic Dynamical Systems Development & Simulating Environment (DSDS DSE) -
a Java desktop application that utilizes McLN formalism to design, implement and simulate the Space Exploration Mission
behavior based controller.

The Discrete Symbolic Dynamical Systems & Models web site (http://www.dsdsam.com) is dedicated to McLN modeling technique.
The main pages of the site are: "McLN Viewer" and "McLN MF".
The "McLN Viewer" page demonstrates several develped in DSDS DSE Discrete Symbolic Dynamical System models
and lets user to simulate their behavior by clicking  Start, Stop, One Step, and Reset buttons.
The "McLN MF" page describes McLN modeling formalism by explaining its structure and behavior.
Both java applications can be downloaded from this web site.

This project page - https://dsdsam.github.io/Kaleidoscope/ describes SEM and DSDS DSE applications.
